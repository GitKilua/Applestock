# Applestock
This repository demonstrates loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing Apple’s 2014 stock price dataset as a proxy for sales data. It includes basic statistical analysis and four types of customized plots—line chart, bar chart, histogram, and scatter plot—providing clear insights into sales trends and patterns over time.
Explanation:
Dataset: Apple stock prices in 2014 from a public GitHub CSV file (used as a sales proxy).
Task 1: Loaded dataset with error handling, displayed first rows, checked data types and missing values, cleaned missing data if any.
Task 2: Computed descriptive statistics, created a new categorical column (month), grouped by month to find average closing price.
Task 3: Created four plots:
Line chart (time series trend)
Bar chart (average price per month)
Histogram (distribution of prices)
Scatter plot (price vs day of month)
All plots have titles, axis labels, and legends where appropriate.
